I created this blog with the intention of sharing the things that I've learnt.
Whenever I try to learn something, I always start by googling it. Unfortunately,
most of the time, I can't easily understand what I'm reading or watching, and I 
spend a lot of time deciphering the wording and terminology used by the author,
on top of having to understand the subject of the article/video/example/etc.

Everyone understands things differently. I want to provide my point of view
on what I've learnt, using the wording that I would understand, and in the process,
hopefully deepen my understanding of the subject and provide quality material for
people to refer to in the future.

This blog is made using Jekyll and deployed using Github Pages. It supports nice
`code highlighting`:

{% highlight js linenos %}
const x = 0;
const y = 5;

console.log(+new Date());
{% endhighlight %}

Let's see where this goes!
